## Introduction

This project combines the power of a large language model (LLM), Streamlit for web interface, Snowflake for data storage, and OpenAI's GPT-3.5 Turbo model to create a chatbot application and perform basic insurance price calculations for various vehicles.

## Installation

To set up this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YashShah2200/gmf-llm.git
Navigate to the project directory:

cd your-repo

Install project dependencies:
pip install streamlit openai snowflake-connector-python

## Configuration
config.py
The config.py file contains sensitive configuration data for connecting to Snowflake and OpenAI. Replace the placeholders with your actual credentials.

python
Copy code
conn_params = {
    "OPENAI_API_KEY": "YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY",
    "account": "ACCOUNT_NAME",
    "region": "REGION",
    "user": "ACCOUNT_USERNAME",
    "password": "PASSWORD",
    "database": "DATABASE_NAME",
    "db_schema": "SCHEMA_NAME"
}
## Usage
## Establishing Connection with LLM, Streamlit, and Snowflake
Follow these steps to establish connections:

Install dependencies (if not already done):
pip install streamlit openai
Get your OpenAI API Key by signing up or logging in to the OpenAI platform.

Establish connection between LLM and Streamlit using your API key.

Establish connection between Snowflake and Streamlit using the config.py file.

## Prompt Engineering
In prompts.py, prompt engineering is performed to guide the AI model's responses. This involves crafting input prompts in a specific way to make interactions with the language model more meaningful and context-aware.

## Running the Streamlit App
Run the Streamlit app using the following command:

streamlit run app.py
## Interacting with SnowPilot Application
Open a web browser and navigate to the Streamlit URL (usually http://localhost:8501).

You should see your Streamlit app running. Enter questions or queries in the provided chat input to interact with the GPT-3.5 Turbo model and display real-time responses.

## Basic Insurance Price
The test_price.py file is used to perform basic insurance price calculations for different vehicles. You can customize and extend this functionality as needed.



Please replace `"YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY"` and other placeholders in `config.py`
